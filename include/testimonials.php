            <!--     As I recall my time spent at CSPIT, CHARUSAT, the most prevalent memories are those of the dedicated professors who truly devoted their time and talents to making sure that my fellow classmates and I were prepared for the challenges that lay ahead. The combination of small class sizes, broad interdisciplinary specialization among the faculty, and a curriculum designed to teach not only the theory of Computer Science, but also the practice, culminated in a valuable education greater than the sum of its parts. So well spent was my time at CSPIT, CHARUSAT, that I felt not only confident in my abilities upon first entering the workforce, but also better prepared than my peers who had graduated from larger, research-based institutions.-->
